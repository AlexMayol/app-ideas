</p>

A Collection of application ideas which can be used to improve your coding skills.


## Motivation

This project is inspired by [@florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) app-ideas repository that are no longer maintened.

So, I decided to create a new one to contineu this such important project for the open source community.

## Intro

Have you ever wanted to build something but you had no idea what to do? Just as
authors sometimes have "writers block" it's also true for developers. This list is intended to solve this issue once and for all! üëç

These applications are:

- great for improving your coding skills :muscle:;
- great for experimenting with new technologies üÜï;
- great for adding to your portfolio to impress your next employer/client :file_folder:;
- great for using as examples in tutorials (articles or videos) :page_with_curl:;
- easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features :ok_hand:;

This is not just a simple list of projects, but a collection that describes each project in enough detail so that you can develop it from the ground up!

**Obs:** Initially, we'll provide a simple list of projects. As soon as possible, we'll append a detailed description for each project ideas.

## Projects

Projects are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience
required to complete them.

| Tier | Developer Profile                                                                                                                                                |

|  1   | Developers in the early stages of their learning journey. Those who are typically focused on creating user-facing applications.                                  |
|  2   | Developers at an intermediate stage of learning and experience. They are comfortable in UI/UX, using development tools, and building apps that use API services. |
|  3   | Developers who have all of the above, and are learning more advanced techniques like implementing backend applications and database services.                    |
